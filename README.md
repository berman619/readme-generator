# Node.js Challenge: Professional README Generator

## Description

As part of the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, I was tasked with creating a Professional README Generator that uses a command-line application to dynamically generate a README.md file from a user's input using the Inquirer package. The application prompts the user to input a title, description, installation instructions, usage information, contribution guidelines, github username, and an e-mail address. It also allows the user to select from a list of license options (such as Apache and MIT) to choose a license, which will be added to the README along with a badge.

While completing this project, I referenced materials from the Columbia Coding Boot Camp, MDN Web Docs, and W3Schools.
